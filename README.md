## What is TornadoSwap!

TornadoSwap is a brand new DeFi project designed by an experienced development team as the 3rd generation deflationary yield farm & AMM on #BSC.
Besides the buyback burning mechanism introduced by Goose Finance, we have implemented some unique innovative features on TornadoSwapâ€™s yield farm to fight against the inflation problem faced by most traditional yield farms and even Goose Finance.

Unlike other deflationary yield farms, we don't plan to develop layered farming after launch. Because we think it doesn't make much sense to keep issuing new tokens by layered farming. 
*Kindly remind, please always Do Your Own Research! Only Invest what you can afford to lose.*
